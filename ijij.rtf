FOR EXAMPLE\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://groups.google.com/groups?q=sleep+group:misc.kids.moderated"}}{\fldrslt sleep group:misc.kids.moderated}} will return articles in the group misc.kids.moderated that contain the word \'93sleep\'94 and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://groups.google.com/groups?q=sleep+group:misc.kids"}}{\fldrslt sleep group:misc.kids}} will return articles in the subarea misc.kids that contain the word \'93sleep.\'94\

Equivalent to intitle:.\
intext:\
The query intext:term restricts results to documents containing term in the text. For instance,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/search?q=Hamish+Reid+intext:pandemonia"}}{\fldrslt Hamish Reid intext:pandemonia}} will return documents that mention the word \'93pandemonia\'94 in the text, and mention the names \'93Hamish\'94 and \'93Reid\'94 anywhere in the document (text or not).\
Note: There must be no space between the intext: and the following word.\
Putting intext: in front of every word in your query is equivalent to putting allintext: at the front of your query, e.g.,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/search?q=intext:handsome+intext:poets"}}{\fldrslt intext:handsome intext:poets}} is the same as\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/search?q=allintext:+handsome+poets"}}{\fldrslt allintext: handsome poets}}.\
intitle:\
The query intitle:term restricts results to documents containing term in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html#title"}}{\fldrslt title}}. For instance, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/search?q=flu+shot+intitle:help"}}{\fldrslt flu shot intitle:help}}\'a0will return documents that mention the word \'93help\'94 in their titles, and mention the words \'93flu\'94 and \'93shot\'94 anywhere in the document (title or not).\
Note: There must be no space between the intitle: and the following word.\
Putting intitle: in front of every word in your query is equivalent to putting allintitle: at the front of your query, e.g., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/search?q=intitle:google+intitle:search"}}{\fldrslt intitle:google intitle:search}}\'a0is the same as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/search?q=allintitle:+google+search"}}{\fldrslt allintitle: google search}}.\
link:\
The query link:URL shows pages that point to that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html#url"}}{\fldrslt URL}}. \cf4 \cb1 \outl0\strokewidth0 FOR EXAMPLE\'a0\cf2 \cb3 \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2  to find pages that point to Google Guide\'92s home page, enter: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/search?q=link:www.googleguide.com"}}{\fldrslt link:www.googleguide.com}}\
Note: According to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/help/features.html#link"}}{\fldrslt Google\'92s documentation}}, \'93you cannot combine a link: search with a regular keyword search.\'94\
Also note that when you combine link: with another advanced operator, Google may not return all the pages that match. The following queries should return lots of results, as you can see if you remove the -site: term in each of these queries.\
location:\
If you include location: in your query on {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.googleguide.com/news.html"}}{\fldrslt Google News}}, only articles from the location you specify will be returned. \cf4 \cb1 \outl0\strokewidth0 FOR EXAMPLE\'a0\cf2 \cb3 \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://news.google.com/news?q=queen+location:canada"}}{\fldrslt queen location:canad}}a will show articles that match the term \'93queen\'94 from sites in Canada. Many other country names work; try them and see.\
Two-letter {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.usps.com/ncsc/lookups/abbreviations.html"}}{\fldrslt US state abbreviations}} match individual US states, and two-letter Canadian province abbreviations (like NS for Nova Scotia) also work \'97 although some provinces don\'92t have many newspapers online, so you may not get many results. Some other two-letter abbreviations \'97 such as UK for the United Kingdom \'97 are also available.\
movie:\
If you include movie: in your query, Google will find movie-related information.\
related:\
The query related:{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html#url"}}{\fldrslt URL}} will list web pages that are similar to the web page you specify. For instance,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/search?q=related:www.consumerreports.org"}}{\fldrslt related:www.consumerreports.org}} will list web pages that are similar to the Consumer Reports home page.\
Note: Don\'92t include a space between the related: and the web page url.\
\
source:\
Restrict your search to articles from the news source with the ID you specify. \cf4 \cb1 \outl0\strokewidth0 FOR EXAMPLE\'a0\cf2 \cb3 \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://news.google.com/news?q=election+source:new_york_times"}}{\fldrslt election source:new_york_times}}\'a0will return articles with the word \'93election\'94 that appear in the New York Times.\
weather\
If you enter a query with the word weather and a city or location name, if Google recognizes the location, the forecast will appear at the top of the results page. Otherwise, your results will usually include links to sites with the weather conditions and forecast for that location.\
Since weather is not an advanced operator, there is no need to include a colon after the word. \cf4 \cb1 \outl0\strokewidth0 FOR EXAMPLE\'a0\cf2 \cb3 \outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/search?c2coff=1&q=weather+Sunnyvale+CA&btnG=Search"}}{\fldrslt weather Sunnyvale CA}}\'a0will return the weather for Sunnyvale, California and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.google.com/search?c2coff=1&q=weather+94041&btnG=Search"}}{\fldrslt weather 94041}} will return the weather for the city containing the zip code (US postal code) 94041, which is Mountain View, California.\
